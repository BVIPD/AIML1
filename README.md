This project has the potential to function as an advanced smart attendance system.
It operates by comparing the images it captures against a previously established database of individuals.
Once the system processes the data, it then displays the results of the identified individuals in a well-organized Excel sheet. 
This format not only facilitates easy access to the information but also allows for further analysis and evaluation of attendance patterns and trends.
In addition to its primary function, the system can also be utilized for the purpose of detecting bombs or identifying any other unusual or suspicious activities occurring in the surrounding area. 
This multi-faceted capability enhances its utility and application in various security and safety contexts.
